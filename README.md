## ‚ú® Overview

**Prisma Editor** is a comprehensive and intuitive web-based editor designed to empower developers to visually create, edit, and manage Prisma ORM schemas. Instead of manually writing Prisma Schema Language (PSL) code, you can define database models, relations, and configurations through a user-friendly interface.

With Prisma Editor, you can easily import existing schemas for visualization and modification, then export your work back to a standard schema.prisma file. Built with responsiveness in mind, it integrates seamlessly into existing dashboards or workflows, making database modeling more accessible and efficient.

## üöÄ Use in Your Prisma Project

Run Prisma Editor directly within your existing Prisma project to visually edit your schema:

```bash
npx prisma-editor
```

This command will:
- Start a local server and load your project's `prisma/schema.prisma` file
- Open the editor UI in your browser: http://localhost:5566
- Allow you to make visual changes
- Save changes directly back to your project when you click "Save Schema"

This provides a convenient way to visually manage your Prisma schema without leaving your project context.
